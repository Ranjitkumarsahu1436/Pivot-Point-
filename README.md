# Pivot-Point-

Pivots Points are significant levels chartists can use to determine directional movement and potential support/resistance levels. Pivot Points use the prior period's high, low and close to estimate future support and resistance levels. In this regard, Pivot Points are predictive or leading indicators. There are at least five different versions of Pivot Points. This article will focus on Standard Pivot Points, Demark Pivot Points and Fibonacci Pivot Points.

Pivot Points were originally used by floor traders to set key levels. Like modern-era day traders, floor traders dealt in a very fast moving environment with a short-term focus. At the beginning of the trading day, floor traders would look at the previous day's high, low and close to calculate a Pivot Point for the current trading day. With this Pivot Point as the base, further calculations were used to set 
Support 1
Support 2 
Resistance 1 
Resistance 2 
These levels would then be used to assist their trading throughout the day.
