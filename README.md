# Pivot-Point-

Pivots Points are significant levels chartists can use to determine directional movement and potential support/resistance levels. Pivot Points use the prior period's high, low and close to estimate future support and resistance levels. In this regard, Pivot Points are predictive or leading indicators. There are at least five different versions of Pivot Points. This article will focus on Standard Pivot Points, Demark Pivot Points and Fibonacci Pivot Points.

Pivot Points were originally used by floor traders to set key levels. Like modern-era day traders, floor traders dealt in a very fast moving environment with a short-term focus. At the beginning of the trading day, floor traders would look at the previous day's high, low and close to calculate a Pivot Point for the current trading day. With this Pivot Point as the base, further calculations were used to set

Support 1

Support 2

Resistance 1 

Resistance 2 

These levels would then be used to assist their trading throughout the day.

# Standard Pivot Points

Standard Pivot Points begin with a base Pivot Point. This is a simple average of the high, low and close. The middle Pivot Point is shown as a solid line between the support and resistance pivots. Keep in mind that the high, low and close are all from the prior period.
Pivot Point (P) = (High + Low + Close)/3

Support 1 (S1) = (P x 2) - High

Support 2 (S2) = P  -  (High  -  Low)

Resistance 1 (R1) = (P x 2) - Low

Resistance 2 (R2) = P + (High  -  Low)
# Why Use
Pivot Points offer chartists a methodology to determine price direction and then set support and resistance levels. Price direction is determined by looking at the current period's price action relative to the pivot point: starting above or below the pivot point, or crossing it in either direction during trading. The set support and resistance points come into play after price direction has been determined. While originally designed for floor traders, the concepts behind Pivot Points can be applied across various timeframes.
